# Trading Algorithms

This project was my fourth year Internet Economics and Financial Technology coursework.
The task was to analyse the performance of a new trading algorithm called PRDE and then extend the algorithm to improve performance.

The report, titled `Parameter Optimisation for Parameterised-Response Traders with Differential Evolution.pdf` gives a detailed description of my project in the style of an academic paper.

The main files of interest are

* `BSE.py` (the extended Bristol Stock Exchange code); and
* `analyser.py` (for performing statistical analysis on the results)

Additional Python and JSON files are provided as examples for various ways of analysing the results.
